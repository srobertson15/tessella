# Tech Mapping Dashboard Demo

This is a self-contained demo of the Tech Mapping Dashboard built with Streamlit. It includes sample data for immediate explorationâ€”no file uploads required!

## Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies** (in a new virtual environment is recommended):
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the app:**
   ```sh
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

3. **Explore:**
   - The dashboard will open in your browser.
   - By default, it loads the included demo data from the `demo_data/` folder.
   - This data has been preprocessed from bio- and e-fuels publications.
